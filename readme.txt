                                2) Command prompt


Steps to run the code succesfully:
1) Download all the files in one folder on desktop say IDEA.(Must be kept in one folder)
2) Start command prompt and set your directory by using >cd desktop

3) After setting the directory use the file name to run the code eg.">TwoCoreProcSCD.py " and press enter.
4) Take a deep breath, output is on its way.
