# Application-specific-processor-for-cryptographic-block-cipher-algorithms
Designed Single Cycle data path with Dual core model implementation using multithreading. 
Tested the design using IDEA (International Data Encryption Algorithm) symmetric-key block cipher algorithm 
written in (Special ISA designed for the specific Processor) Assembly Language.
